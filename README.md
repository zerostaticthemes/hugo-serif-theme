## Installation

**1. Install Hugo**

To use this theme you will first need to have Hugo installed. Please follow the official [installation guide](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Check your Hugo version - **Hugo Extended** is required!

This theme uses [Hugo Pipes](https://gohugo.io/hugo-pipes/scss-sass/) to compile SCSS and minify assets which means if you not using the Hugo extended version this theme will not work. To check your version of Hugo, run  `hugo version`. Make sure you see __/extended__ after the version number, for example _Hugo Static Site Generator v0.51/extended darwin/amd64 BuildDate: unknown_ You do not need to use version v0.51 specifically, it just needs to have the _/extended_ part.

**2. Create a new Hugo site**

This will create a fresh Hugo site in the folder `mynewsite`.

```
hugo new site mynewsite
```

**3. Install the theme**

Download or git clone this theme into the sites themes folder `mynewsite/themes`. You should end up with the following folder structure `mynewsite/themes/hugo-serif-theme`

```
cd mynewsite
git clone https://github.com/zerostaticthemes/hugo-serif-theme.git themes/hugo-serif-theme
```

**4. Copy the example content**

Copy the entire contents of the `mynewsite/themes/hugo-serif-theme/exampleSite/` folder to root folder of your Hugo site, ie `mynewsite/`. To copy the files using terminal, make sure you are still in the projects root, ie the `mynewsite` folder.

```
cp -a themes/hugo-serif-theme/exampleSite/. .
```

**5. Update config.toml**

After you copy the `config.toml` into the root folder of your Hugo site you will need to update the `baseURL`, `themesDir` and `theme` values in `mynewsite/config.toml`

```
baseURL = "/"
themesDir = "themes"
theme = "hugo-serif-theme"
```

**6. Run Hugo**

After installing the theme for the first time, generate the Hugo site.

You run this command from the root folder of your Hugo site ie `mynewsite/`

```
hugo
```

For local development run Hugo's built-in local server.

```
hugo server
```

Now enter [`localhost:1313`](http://localhost:1313) in the address bar of your browser.

## Deployment

### Netlify

Use Netlify to deploy this theme. This theme contains a valid and tested `netlify.toml` - Feel free to use the 1-click deploy below.

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/zerostaticthemes/hugo-serif-theme)


## Configuring Theme

### Logo

You can edit the logo from the `config.toml`

```toml
# config.toml

  [params.logo]
    mobile = "images/logo/logo-mobile.svg"
    mobile_height = "36px"
    desktop = "images/logo/logo.svg"
    desktop_height = "36px"
    alt = "Serif - A Hugo Business Theme"
```

### Fonts

This theme uses Google fonts. You can change the google font in the `config.toml` - These fonts are injected into the `style.scss` as SCSS variables.

```toml
# config.toml 

  [params.fonts]
    # sets the google font link in layouts/partials/google-fonts.html
    google_fonts = 'https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Playfair+Display:wght@600&family=Source+Sans+Pro:wght@400;700&display=swap'
    heading = "Playfair Display"
    base = "Source Sans Pro"
```

### Colors

You can edit the themes main colors in the `config.toml`. These colors are injected into the `style.scss` as SCSS variables.

```toml
#config.toml

  [params.colors]
    primary = "#f24088"
    black = "#2f2f41"
    white = "#ffffff"
    white_offset = "#f6f7ff"
    grey = "#5C5A5A"
```

### Intro Image

List pages such as the homepage, services and team can have a Intro image. 

```yml
# content/_index.md 
---
intro_image: "https://source.unsplash.com/wOGhHamMqLc"
intro_image_absolute: false
intro_image_hide_on_mobile: true
---
```

While this themes default content uses illustrations, its easy to change the image to a photo and it will still look great. 

the front-matter field `intro_image_absolute: true` let's illustrations "break out" (in CSS terms, it uses `position: absolute`) of the grid and is an intended stylistic effect. When using photos or normal images it's recommended to set this field to false and the photo will align with the grid. See `content/team/_index.md` for an example.


### Google Analytics

Put your Google Analytics ID in the `google_analytics_id` field in the `config.toml` - Also supports Google Tag Manager. When your site is running locally using `hugo server` the GA tag is not injected. This prevents polluting your real data.

```toml
# config.toml

[params]
  google_analytics_id = "UA-XXX-1"
  google_tag_manager_id = ""
```

 You can also set the Google Analytics ID using a [Netlify environment variable](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/environment-variables/) `HUGO_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID`
 
### Meta tags

A pages `<title>` is generated from the front-matter `title` and the site title set in `config.toml`. You can override the `<title>` on any page by using the `meta_title` field in the front-matter. See `content/_index.md` for an example.

The meta description field is generated from the front-matter `description`

OG meta data for Facebook and Twitter is also generated. 

```toml
# config.toml

  [params.seo]
    meta_twitter_site = "@zerostaticio"
    meta_twitter_creator = "@zerostaticio"
    meta_og_image = "https://www.zerostatic.io/theme/hugo-serif/hugo-serif-screenshot.png"
```
